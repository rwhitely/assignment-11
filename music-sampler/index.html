<div id="Info">Muse is a British rock band started in 1992 by three high school friends in southern England. The band is still made up of the same three members today: guitarist/vocalist Matt Bellamy, bassist/backup vocalist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard. As any band, Muse started off small and remained small for its first five years, until the band's first EP, the <i>Muse EP</i> was released in 1997. Fame quickly followed and the band's first feature-length album, <i>Showbiz</i> was released in 1999 along with a host of single EPs. The band's second album, <i>Origin of Symmetry</i> was released in 2001 to critical acclaim across England. The band first made it big stateside with their 2003 fan-favorite third album, <i>Absolution,</i> and its hit songs <i>Time is Running Out</i> and <i>Hysteria</i>. The band's fourth album, 2006's <i>Black Holes and Revelations</i> brought the band even more fame worldwide, with one of the band's biggest hits ever, <i>Knights of Cydonia</i> coming from the album. 2009 brought Muse's first number one hit in America, <i>The Resistance</i> and won a Grammy on the strength of the megahit <i>Uprising</i>. Muse followed up <i>The Resistance</i> with <i>The 2nd Law</i> in 2012 and recently released the mega-hyped album <i>Drones</i> this past summer. Muse's sound has changed a lot over the years, but has always been characterized by heavy, prog-rock influenced instrumentals, electronic-influenced beats, and heavy bass and drums.</div>

<p>Solo from <b>Knights of Cydonia</b> on 2006's <i>Black Holes and Revelations</i>. Knights became a fan favorite and has been played at nearly every Muse concert since the song came out, usually closing out either a setlist or the entire concert. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Yc3HhSl1Q">Its music video</a> has also gained fame across the internet.</p>

<p>Chorus from <b>Undisclosed Desires</b> on 2009's <i>The Resistance.</i> Undisclosed Desires was one of Muse's first "pop-sounding" hits and is one of the band's most popular mainstream hits. Since then, Muse has expanded a bit more into "pop-ish" territory with hits such as Madness and Dead Inside on newer albums.</p>

<p>Chorus and bridge from <b>Panic Station</b> on 2012's <i>The 2nd Law.</i> Panic Station originally began as an experiment in slap bass by bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and then became one of the album's standout hits, almost immediately becoming a fan-favorite and then loved even more after the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uBK5kvakD8">its goofy music video.</a></p>

<p>Second part of solo from <b>Reapers</b> on 2015's <i>Drones.</i> Perhaps one of Muse's most hardcore songs, Reapers was also one of the most highly anticipated songs from the album after some teaser play during a pre-release tour across Britain. Reapers has become a fan-favorite from the new album very quickly.</p>
